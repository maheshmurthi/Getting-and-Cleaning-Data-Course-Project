# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Code Files and Output files for the Course Project on Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The
goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Data Set is available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Objective is to:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
variable for each activity and each subject.
